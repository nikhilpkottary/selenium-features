# Selenium Features Documentation

This repository is aimed at documenting various **Selenium features** with code implementations and examples. The project is still **a work in progress**, and more features will be added over time.

## Features Implemented

- **Waits in Selenium**
    - **Implicit Wait**: Automatically waits for a specified amount of time before throwing a "No Such Element" exception.
    - **Explicit Wait**: Allows waiting for a specific condition to occur before proceeding with the next step.
    - **Fluent Wait**: Similar to explicit wait but with more fine-grained control, like polling frequency and ignoring specific exceptions.
